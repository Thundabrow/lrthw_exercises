What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
Reading and writing, attention to detail, spotting differences.


Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing:  General literacy and facility with the keyboard and other computer commands.

Attention to detail:  Precision.  Attendance to the minutiae of the language.  

Spotting differences:  This is a subset of attention to detail, as details consist of small differences.  
In the coding world this means remembering to add the proper punctuation and syntax to one's statements,
and the ability to notice when a statement is missing an essential ingredient.



Why do you need to not copy and paste?

This is counterproductive because it does not force the student to attend to detail in the same 
way as manually typing commands.  



Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Learning complex new skills requires consistent practice and
persistence.  This is something that I learned the hard way.
I was identified as academically "gifted" in school and most 
subjects came easily to me.  I developed a distaste for repetitive
practice because I thought that smart students didn't need to 
repeatedly drill.  It wasn't until I was in my late 20's that
I finally studied enough educational psychology to understand
that repetition is essential for skill development in certain areas.
This "growth" rather than "fixed" mindset has benefited me enormously
academically and professionally and I'm happy to see that Da Vinci
places such an emphasis on it.
